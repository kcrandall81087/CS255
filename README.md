**DriverPass Project Summary**

The DriverPass project was developed for a client named DriverPass, a company that provides services to help students pass their driving exams. The client wanted a system that could support online learning, allow students to schedule and manage driving lessons with instructors, provide practice exams, track student progress, and handle administrative needs such as user management and reporting. My role was to analyze the client’s requirements, capture them in a business requirements document, and then design a system that met those needs using UML diagrams and technical specifications.

**What I Did Well**

One aspect I did particularly well was capturing the customer’s needs clearly in the business requirements document. I translated the interview information into concrete, well-organized requirements that established the foundation for the system design. In the design phase, I was able to structure the UML diagrams so that they represented the system’s functions, actors, and interactions in a way that was both readable and aligned to best practices.

**What I Would Revise**

If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the UML diagrams in the system design document. While they correctly captured the system’s functionality, I believe some diagrams could be simplified to remove redundancy and improve clarity for stakeholders who may not have a technical background. For example, ensuring consistent naming conventions and reducing visual overlap would make them more professional and easier to understand.

**Interpreting and Implementing User Needs**

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully reviewing the interview transcript, identifying key functional requirements, and validating them against the project scope. For example, the need to schedule lessons was implemented through the inclusion of an Instructor, Student, and Lesson object in the design, with associated use cases for scheduling, rescheduling, and canceling. Considering user needs is essential because a system that does not meet the end-user’s expectations or workflow will ultimately fail, regardless of its technical quality.

**My Approach to Designing Software**

My approach to designing software is iterative and user-centered. I begin by gathering requirements from stakeholders, then translating those into models (such as UML diagrams) that provide a visual and logical representation of the system. I value feedback loops with users and stakeholders to validate assumptions early and often. In the future, I plan to use more Agile techniques, such as user stories and acceptance criteria, alongside traditional UML models. This combination ensures both technical completeness and usability. I would also like to use prototyping tools more often to help visualize the user interface and workflow during the design stage.
